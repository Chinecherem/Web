					<p class="test-p"> My name is precious Nwaokike ,and I started attending the code lagos class after two weeks that it started, the only reason I was able to pick up and understand was due to my capable ,humble teacher miss blessing , who took out time to go back and retake me on topics I missed out on, I'm still getting the hang of it but I have a capable tutor who is showing me the route, this is an amazing class and it has really changed an aspect of my life.  I'm so excited , to join the next session and continue my course.</p>

				<p class="test-p"> Code Lagos have been the channel God used to answer my quest for knowledge in the programming world and to set me on my career path. Having Miss Blessing as my facilitator has also been an added advantage because she made me understand better with her modern method of teaching unlike an unpalatable experience I had sometimes ago, this made me become more enthusiastic about coding and having a strong urge I can do it!!...Web development is just the beginning for me ..I see myself soaring higher and higher in the tech world. To everyone that made this possible His Excellency  Governor Ambode, eRead Africa, Miss Blessing a special thanks to you.</p>
